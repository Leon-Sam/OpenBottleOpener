Make an (Open) Bottle Opener for yourself and your buddies

# Why this exists

Sometimes when using SendCutSend you only need a $10 part, but need to spend $30+ dollars for the min spend requirement.

Make some bottle openers! Make it for yourself, and your buddies! Stockpile them for stocking stuffer gifts

# How to use this
Go to the repo, download the .dxf file and upload it to SendCutSend to get those numbers up!
If you want to edit the shape, download the Fusion file and edit the sketch directly.

# Disclaimers:
Check your laws to make sure these bottle openers are legal for your use case. 

# Want to contribute?
-  This is repo is partially gag/joke repo, but this does scratch an idea that's living rent-free in my head. 
- Can you consume open source hardware just like open source software?
  - Want to realize an instance of an "open hardware" project? 1-click order/BOM sourcing with guided documentation.
- In a perfect world, you visit a website, drag some sliders for parameters, and "one click" order/make the whole BOM.
  - In the case of these bottle openers:
    - Length/Weight would be parameteric
    - Different shape(s) would be available (straight/curved)
    - Grinding jigs can be 3d printed locally/ordered
- Pull requests are welcome.
    - Feel free to update the README on material/thickness/documention etc
